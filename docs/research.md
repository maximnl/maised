# Research and development 
Time series approach enables many analitical applications that otherwise are costly/hard to develop. We have a number of ongoing researchers. 
Please let us know if you would like to contribute or join. We need both researchers and (business) testers. 

## Search of time series
A modern database environment such as (Azure) SQL Server is traditionally seen as a database with the main function of reading and writing relational data while all application logic is moved to the application layer.  For many data intensive applications this implies intensive data load. At the same time the modern databases offer an increasingly rich programming/computational environment which allows to balance data loads and implement certain application logics closer to the data , at the database level. We try to exploit these possibilities in the time series context. 

Time series occur in various scientific and management applications such as management information, forecasting, stock market data, weather data, IoT. We apply SQL server language for time series search and measurement of similarity between the time series. At present, SQL Server has no standard libraries known to us that could simplify the implementation.
